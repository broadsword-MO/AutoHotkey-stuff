;; if capslock is toggled, remap it to esc

;; note: must use tilde prefix to fire hotkey once it is pressed,

~Capslock::
    ;; must use downtemp to emulate hyper key, you cannot use down in this case 
    ;; according to https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm,
    ;; downtemp is the same as down except for ctrl/alt/shift/win keys
    ;; in those cases, downtemp tells subsequent sends that the key is not permanently down, and may be 
    ;; released whenever a keystroke calls for it.
    ;; for example, Send {Ctrl Downtemp} followed later by Send {Left} would produce a normal {Left}
    ;; keystroke, not a Ctrl{Left} keystroke
    Send {Ctrl DownR}{Shift DownR}{Alt DownR}{LWin DownR}
